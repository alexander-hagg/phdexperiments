Preparing mesh for OpenFOAM


1. remove all holes. There are online tools for that (3D printing companies)
2. Use AutoDesk Netfabb to remesh uniformly (academic license is free)
3. Make sure to center the mesh around the XY origin! Snappyhexmesh expects it to be in the center of the wind tunnel

4. Change settngs to Snappyhexmesh. Ignore the refinemesh and instead grow the mesh out from the mirror surface. Set the final layer thickness

    refinementRegions
    {
        carMirror
        {
            mode distance;
            levels ( (0.03 7) (0.1 5) (0.3 4) (2.0 2)); // levels must be ordered nearest first 
        }
    }


    // Wanted thickness of final added cell layer. If multiple layers
    // is the thickness of the layer furthest away from the wall.
    // Relative to undistorted size of cell outside layer.
    // See relativeSizes parameter.
    finalLayerThickness 0.03;

    // Minimum thickness of cell layer. If for any reason layer
    // cannot be above minThickness do not add layer.
    // Relative to undistorted size of cell outside layer.
    minThickness 0.03;
