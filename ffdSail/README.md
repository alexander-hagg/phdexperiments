# sail
Source code for the Surrogate-Assisted Illumination (SAIL) algorithm, as
described in: 

"Data-Efficient Exploration, Optimization, and Modeling of Diverse Designs
 through Surrogate-Assisted Illumination" presented at GECCO 2017. 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03713

and 

"Aerodynamic Design Exploration through Surrogate-Assisted Illumination"
presented at AIAA Aviation and Aeronautics Forum 2017.

     Two domains are provided: 2D airfoils (help airfoil) and 3D velomobile 
     shells (help velo). To apply SAIL to a new domain only new representation 
     and evaluation functions must be created. More sample domains will be made
     public as their are published. If you are interested in creating a new
     domain and having trouble, don't hesistate to ask!

     A third domain is now included airfoils created with free form deformations.

Produced using
